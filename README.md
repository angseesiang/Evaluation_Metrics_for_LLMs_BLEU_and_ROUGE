This repository contains my training exercise on **evaluation metrics
for Large Language Models (LLMs)**, focusing on **BLEU (Bilingual
Evaluation Understudy)** and **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for
Gisting Evaluation)**.

It explains how these metrics are applied to measure the quality of text
generated by LLMs against reference outputs. The notebook includes
theoretical background, worked examples, and practical code
demonstrations.

## üìå Notes

-   This notebook was created during my **AI training** to strengthen
    understanding of NLP evaluation methods.
-   It is intended as an educational resource and can serve as a
    reference for researchers, students, or practitioners exploring LLM
    evaluation.
